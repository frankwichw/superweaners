<h1>Elephant Seals</h1>

<p>Elephant seals are my favorite animal. Elephant seals are a species of true seal. They are the largest type of seal, 
males reaching up to 8,800 pounds. They "haul out" of the ocean three times a year: once during mating season, once to birth 
their pups, and once to molt. Once born, elephant seal pups quickly gain weight as they consume large amounts of their mother's
 milk, which has the consistency of yoghurt. Once weaned, seal pups are called "weaners". Some male seal pups continue to
 seek more milk even after being weaned. These pups will wander the beach looking for milk-producing females who will allow them
 to suckle. These weaners balloon to huge sizes, earning them the scientific title of "super-weaners".</p>
