		<p>Oh! hush thee, my baby, the night is behind us,</p>
   		<p>And black are the waters that sparkled so green.</p>
		<p>The moon, o’er the combers, looks downward to find us </p>
  		<p>At rest in the hollows that rustle between. </p>
		<p>Where billow meets billow, there soft be thy pillow; </p>
		<p>Ah, weary wee flipperling, curl at thy ease! </p>
		<p>The storm shall not wake thee, nor shark overtake thee, </p>
  		<p>Asleep in the arms of the slow-swinging seas. </p>
  		<p>- Rudyard Kipling, 1865 - 1936</p>

		<p>Elephant seals are my favorite animal. Elephant seals are a species of true seal. They are the largest type of seal, 
		males reaching up to 8,800 pounds. They "haul out" of the ocean three times a year: once during mating season, once to birth 
		their pups, and once to molt.</p>
	
		<p>Once born, elephant seal pups quickly gain weight as they consume large amounts of their mother's
 		milk, which has the consistency of yogurt. Once weaned, seal pups are called "weaners". Some male seal pups continue to
		seek more milk even after being weaned. These pups will wander the beach looking for milk-producing females who will allow them
 		to suckle. These weaners balloon to huge sizes, earning them the scientific title of "super-weaners".</p>
